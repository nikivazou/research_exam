\section{Conclusion}
In this report we presented various refinement type systems.
We started with type systems where the predicates can be arbitrary expressions.
Even though these systems are expressive, the assertions formed can not be statically
verified. Thus to reason about such systems, the user should provide explicit proves
for the assertions, as in interactive theorem proving, 
or the assertions can be verified at run time, as in contracts calculi.
Next we presented Liquid Types, a dependent type system 
which restricts the predicate language, thus both type checking and inference
is decidable.
Finally, we presented Abstract Refinement Types, a means which can be used
in a refinement type system to increase expressiveness without increasing complexity.
